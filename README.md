## Academic Integrity Policy:
Although students are encouraged to help their classmates, students sharing code are guilty of plagiarism. If programs are considered too similar, the students will be asked to explain. The Dean will be notified about any such offenses as well as the Academic Code of Conduct Committee.   In all cases of cheating, students who supply code or take it will both be penalized. The penalty for all students involved in academic integrity violations is failure in the class.  Under no circumstances may sites like chegg.com be used, you may not cite them as a source.
