Although students are encouraged to help their classmates, students sharing code are guilty of plagiarism. If programs are considered too similar, the students will be asked to explain.

The penalty for all students involved in academic integrity violations is failure in the class.  Under no circumstances may sites like chegg.com be used, you may not cite them as a source.
